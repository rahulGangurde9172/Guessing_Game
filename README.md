# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple console-based number guessing game developed in C#. The goal of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10 within a limited number of attempts.

## Features
1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - The game generates a random number between 1 and 10 at the start of each new game.
  
2. **Limited Attempts**:
   - The player has only 5 chances to guess the correct number.
   - The game tracks the number of attempts made by the player.

3. **User Input Validation**:
   - The game allows the player to input their guesses, which are then checked against the randomly generated number.
  
4. **Game Feedback**:
   - After each guess, the game provides feedback:
     - "Your guess is too big" if the guess is larger than the target number.
     - "Your guess is too small" if the guess is smaller than the target number.
     - "You won!" if the guess is correct.
  
5. **Game Over Condition**:
   - If the player fails to guess the number within 5 attempts, the game informs them that the chances are over and reveals the correct number.
   
6. **Attempts Tracking**:
   - The game tracks the total number of guesses made, and if the player wins, it displays how many attempts it took.
